# Format string exploit

To run this script you must use Python 2.7 and have pwntools installed.
Additionally to run it without changing anything the paths it must be run at the top level of our project, such that `grass.conf` is on the same level, and such that the binaries can be found in bin/.

Then one can execute it as follows:

```bash
$ python exploit_put.py
```

It only works "out of the box" like this if ASLR is disabled and no changes where made to the code structure. However the script also contains some helpers to adapt the exploit to a different code. (see script for explanations.)
