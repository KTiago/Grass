# Format string exploit

You can run this exploit using Python 2.7 and having pwntools installed, by executing

```bash
$ python exploit_put.py
```

It only works "out of the box" like this if ASLR is disabled and no changes where made to the code structure. However the script also contains some helpers to adapt the exploit to a different code. (see script for explanations.)
