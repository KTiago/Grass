# First Buffer Overlow exploit

To run this script you must use Python 2.7 and have pwntools installed.
Additionally to run it without changing the paths it must be run at the top level of our project, such that `grass.conf` is on the same level, and such that the binaries can be found in bin/.

Then one can execute it as follows:

```bash
$ python bof_exploit_exec.py
```

Note that we ran the exploit on a fresh Kali Linux VM compiling with g++ version 8.2.0. If the compiler version is different, the address of the function hijack_flow() may change and thus the exploit may fail.
