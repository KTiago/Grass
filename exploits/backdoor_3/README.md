# Third Backdoor exploit - MORE INFORMATION IN THE PDF !

To run this script you must use Python 2.7 and have pwntools installed.
Additionally to run it without changing the paths it must be run at the top level of our project, such that `grass.conf` is on the same level, and such that the binaries can be found in bin/.

Then one can execute it as follows:

```bash
$ python backdoor_3.py
```
